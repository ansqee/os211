# Top 10 List of Week 01

1. [Vim Tutor](www2.geog.ucl.ac.uk/~plewis/teaching/unix/vimtutor)
This website gives short description and guide about the many commands on vim.
Very helpful for a beginner like me, and I do think I will use this site again and again in the future.

2. [Installing Debian in VirtualBox](linuxhint.com/install_debian10_virtualbox)
As someone who has never used VirtualBox before, this site helped me to know the basics.
It taught me how to navigate over the software and how to install Debian.

3. [Bash Cheatsheet](devhints.io/bash)
A quick reference site to getting started with Bash scripting.
Contains all the basic Bash scripts a beginner would need.
