# Top 10 List of Week 08

1. [CPU Scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpu-scheduling-in-operating-systems/)<br>
A neat guide to CPU scheduling, with every little term explained so I can understand, like those definitions like arrival time, burst time, turn around time, etc. The nice thing about the page is it has exercises I can try if I want to understand more about scheduling. It reminds me to POK for some reason.

2. [CPU and I/O Burst Cycles](https://youtu.be/pVzb3TUcDLo)<br>
A short nice video explaining what burst cycles are. Written guides usually have graphs on them, which I don't really get, but this video explained it with easy step-by-step processes which is pretty nice and easy to understand. This topic is pretty hard to do though so I had to get more sources other than this video.

3. [Asymmetric and Symmetric Multiprocessing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-asymmetric-and-symmetric-multiprocessing/)<br>
Succinct, to the point, and easy to understand. That's what this page is, explaining the differences between asymmetric and symmetric multiprocessing with a table and some graphs. My main take from this is that that in asymmetric, not all processors are treated equally, while in symmetric all processors are treated equally.

4. [NUMA](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~echow/ipcc/hpc-course/HPC-numa.pdf)<br>
A nostalgic, PPT-format guide to non-uniform memory access. Why nostalgic? Because it has text, some kinda-too-complicated graphs, and some pictures, just like POK ppts. It's not a bad thing though, because I actually like this format. This guide explained all the necessary bits about NUMA, even though there are some definions I don't understand yet. It can easily be fixed by GSGSing.

5. [Load Balancing](https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/load-balancing/)<br>
A page from NGINX itself, explaining about load balancind. Even though this page isn't entirely about OS and more about webdev, I still like it because the graphs are actually neat (no offense but most CS websites don't!), it has a short video around the topic, and the website looks good. A bit too biased, I know, but as someone learning webdev, I enjoyed my experience here.

6. [Hard and Soft Real Time System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-hard-real-time-and-soft-real-time-system/)<br>
Another comparison/difference article from Geeks for Geeks. I picked this page because it's terribly to the point, even more than site number 3. Aside from the bad grammar, this page has easy examples that are easy to understand, so I had no real problems with this page. What I understood here is that hard real time system is much more restrictive than soft real hard system, among other things.

7. [Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm](https://www.guru99.com/round-robin-scheduling-example.html)<br>
Every CS article should be like this page, or at least try to. I can't stress this enough. This page actually explains the example clearly and has an illustration graph for every step, so I could understand what is going on. Other than that, this page also has advantages and disadvantages about round robin scheduling and it's very thoroughly explained.

8. [Completely Fair Scheduling (CFS)](https://youtu.be/scfDOof9pww)<br>
A video about Completely Fair Scheduling (CFS). This video not only explains about CFS, but also about how fairness works in scheduling and also some other related scheduling. Even though this video is a bit on the longer side, I didn't have a problem with that and even quite liked it because it covered a lot of topics.

9. [First Come First Serve Method](https://www.guru99.com/fcfs-scheduling.html)<br>
This page explains about the First Come First Serve Method, an OS scheduling algorithm labelled as the easiest and simplest algorithm. It's said in this algorithm, processes which requests the CPU first get the CPU allocation first. Very simple and succinct, and also has an example with tables and illustrations. To me, this is the most basic yet satisfying type or articles out there.

10. [Linux From Scratch](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/10.1/chapter01/how.html)<br>
The official gateway page for Linux from Scratch, explaining the big main steps for building linux from scratch. Before doing this week's assignment, I quickread this page and also the links in it to understand the outline of the assignment.
