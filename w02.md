# Top 10 List of Week 02

1. [System Security - Protection](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/14_Protection.html)<br>
This page explains the goals, principles, and domain of protenction.
It also covers access matrix and how it can be implemented in an OS.

2. [Difference between Private Key and Public Key](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-private-key-and-public-key/)<br>
Serves a table of difference between Private Key and Public Key.
From this, I learnt that Private Key is faster and symmetrical.
Public Key is slower and asymmetrical.

3. [Cryptosystems, Asymmetric and Symmetric](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cryptography/cryptosystems.htm)<br>
Apparently there are two types of encryption, asymmetric and symmetric.
Symmetric key encryption is the encryption process where the same keys are used for both encrypting and decrypting.
Asymmetric key encryption is one where there are two set of keys; one for encrypting and one for decrypting.

4. [Cryptography Hash Functions](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cryptography/cryptography_hash_functions.htm)<br>
I had no idea how cryptography worked before this week, just only heard tidbits from the linear algebra class I took (and somehow passed) last year.
I looked up about cryptography and learnt about hash function is a function that converts numerical input value to another, more compressed, numerical value.
It's used for security.
I noticed that in this class, SHA, which is short for Secure Hash Function, is mentioned a lot.

5. [SHA256 Hash Function](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/sha256.html)<br>
This online app converts our input to SHA256 encryption.
What's unique from this online app is that the conversion happens live and I don't have to click on an "convert" button everytime I want to convert something new. Pretty handy.

6. [Beginnerâ€™s Guide to Internet Safety & Privacy](https://choosetoencrypt.com/privacy/complete-beginners-guide-to-internet-safety-privacy/)<br>
Description.
A site provided on this class's slide, but a good site nonetheless.
In this hyper digital world where everything can be super easily accessed, sometimes I forget that my (and everyone's) privacy is at risk.
I got too comfortable with a lot of app's sign-in-everywhere-easily feature and random forms lying around the interwebs.
This site sure reminded me of how risky it is to provide personal info into the net and be more careful in the future.

7. [C Language Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/index.htm)<br>
Call me a noob all you want, but I've never really touched C Language before this class.
I took some sweet fun time learning this language on my weekend and it's surprisingly not that hard to grasp, maybe because I have prior knowledge about Java.
It is still a challenge though, and I am looking forward to use it for this class in the future.

8. [C Cheatsheet](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse351/14sp/sections/1/Cheatsheet-c.pdf)<br>
Again, nothing like a good, dirty, cheatsheet to help me learn to code, this time for C Language.
I've always liked jam packed cheatsheets where everything is in eye's reach.
I can skim through the sheet or just simply press ctrl+f and I'm good to go! 

9. [Denial of Service Attack](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-015)<br>
DoS this, DoS that, I've seen the term "DoS" used when a website wants to show off how good their security is, so I went to GSGS it.
From this site I learnt that DoS attack occurs when legitimate users are unable to access systems due to the actions of a malicious cyber threat actor.
The cyber threat actor (or hacker in short, lol) floods the poor target's network with so many things that the system just crashes.
Pretty sad if you ask me.

10. [Biometrics](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F0-387-30038-4_13)<br>
How can biometrics be used for user authentication?
This page answers it all, in a way that's too heavy for me to be honest.
I did learn that there are two types of biomterics: physiological and behavioral.
Both are pretty self-explanatory: physiological uses physical features like the iris, ear, face, etc. while behavioural needs a user to do something like talking, writing, or stroking.
